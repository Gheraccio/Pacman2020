\begin{abstract}
  In this paper, we study the \emph{Pacman effect}, where the Pacman disappears
  from the leftmost part of the screen when reaching it, and re-appears from
  the rightmost part of the screen.
  We apply the Pacman effect to \emph{unify} the theory of flat and spherical
  Earth, proposing the \emph{Disc-Sphere Duality}.
  We conclude that a spherical Earth is basically the same as a flat Earth
  under the Pacman effect, bring peace to believers of both theory.

\section{Introduction}

The aim of this paper is to bring peace! For years very smart people have been
fighting over the shape of our beautiful, albeit shitty, planet. Two equally
reasonable positions have mainly emerged: the Earth is a disc VS the Earth is
an oblate spheroid (that we approximate with a sphere, from now on).
This two very different bidimensional manifolds have both equal rights
to claim themselves the proper geometrical model for Earth. Thus they started
fighting. With what army? Well, Flat Earth Societies are fighting in the blue
corner alongside the multiple-millennia champion Disc. In the red corner we see
the young arrogant opponent, the Sphere, supported by its team: Science and
everyone else.

They have been fighting round after round for centuries, with equal
credibility, and the match seemed impossible to settle. There was this dark
moment in history where the evil and arrogant was unfairly holding our beloved
champion against the ropes. All seemed lost. How can planes fly in
circumferences around the globe if the globe is not a globe? That was a tough
one, also a shitty move in the authors' opinion. Then Pacman, the fairest
referee of all, came to save the day.

The main contribution of this work is none. However, we would like to remind
everyone that the Pacman effect is a thing. Airplanes can fly to the extreme
boundary of Earth, but they are bound to reappear on the diametrically opposite
side of the disc, just like Pacman in the famous Namco video game. Now when
forced to apply the rigour of mathematics (reluctantly: reasoning is for nerds!
Nerds suck!), we see that the Pacman effect can be modelled as the
identification of the boundary of the disc to one single point.

Counterintuitively this Pacman effect sheds new light on the Truth. The disc
with such identified border is nothing but a surface diffeomorph to the sphere.
As Einstein once said:

\begin{quote}
``It seems as though we must use sometimes the one theory and sometimes the
other, while at times we may use either. We are faced with a new kind of
difficulty. We have two contradictory pictures of reality; separately neither
of them fully explains the phenomena of \sout{light} Earth, but together they do.''
\end{quote}

We have discovered what we call the ``disc-sphere duality''.

\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
Our work clearly shows that, thanks to the Pacman effect, the two main mathematical models from literature, applied to describe the planet Earth, are actually the same. So the so-called literature should put some more effort in finding more than one boring model for our planet.

As for related and future work, finding out whether Australia actually exists and, if so, where it is located, goes beyond the aim of this paper. Indeed, we have discovered a truly marvelous proof of this, which this margin is too narrow to contain.
